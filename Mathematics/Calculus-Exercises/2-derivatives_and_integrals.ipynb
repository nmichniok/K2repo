It can also tell us the probability of $x$ falling within an interval. That is, if we knew the probability density function representing the probability of grades in our fictional class, calculating $P(11 < x < 12)$ would give us the probability that we’re looking for. But how do we calculate this? It turns out that this probability is the area enclosed by the graph of the probability density function and the $x$-axis between the points $x = 11$ and $x = 12$. Assuming an arbitrary probability density function, Figure 1-8 demonstrates this."
